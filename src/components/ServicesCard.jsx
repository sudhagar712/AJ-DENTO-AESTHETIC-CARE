            title: "Root Canal Treatment in Anna Nagar, Chennai",
            p1: "Tooth pain is often a signal of infection deep within the tooth structure. Root canal treatment is a restorative procedure designed to remove infected pulp tissue, disinfect the canal system, and seal the tooth to prevent reinfection. At AJ Dento Aesthetic Care in Anna Nagar, we approach root canal treatment with precision-driven planning supported by digital X-ray diagnostics.",
            p2: "When bacteria enter the inner layers of a tooth due to decay, cracks, or trauma, inflammation and discomfort may follow. Early intervention prevents further complications and helps preserve the natural tooth. Our process begins with detailed clinical evaluation to assess the extent of infection. The infected pulp tissue is carefully removed, the canal is cleaned and disinfected, and the tooth is sealed. When required, a crown is placed to restore structural strength.",
            p3: "Modern techniques and controlled anesthesia ensure that treatment is focused on relieving pain rather than causing it. Root canal therapy allows patients in Anna Nagar and Chennai to retain their natural teeth while restoring function and comfort. Consultation and evaluation determine the appropriate treatment pathway and long-term care plan."

            title: "Dental Implants in Anna Nagar, Chennai",
            p1: "Dental implants are advanced tooth replacement solutions designed to restore both function and aesthetics. They integrate with the jawbone and serve as stable foundations for crowns, bridges, or full-arch restorations. At AJ Dento Aesthetic Care in Anna Nagar, implant dentistry is planned through detailed evaluation and digital diagnostics to ensure structural accuracy.",
            p2: "Implants are often recommended for individuals with missing teeth who seek a long-term, fixed alternative to removable dentures. The process begins with clinical examination and imaging to evaluate bone support and overall oral health. After structured planning, the implant fixture is placed precisely within the jawbone. Following a healing phase that allows integration with bone, the final restoration is secured to complete the process.",
            p3: "Implant-based rehabilitation restores chewing efficiency, preserves jawbone structure, and enhances smile confidence. Each implant case is customized based on anatomical considerations and long-term stability goals. Consultation ensures clarity before treatment begins."

            p1: "Invisalign treatment uses clear, removable aligners to gradually reposition teeth without visible metal brackets. At AJ Dento Aesthetic Care in Anna Nagar, Invisalign planning begins with structured orthodontic assessment supported by diagnostic evaluation.",
            p2: "Clear aligners are often chosen by working professionals, college students, and adults seeking discreet smile correction. Treatment is designed to address mild to moderate crowding, spacing, or bite alignment concerns. Each aligner is custom fabricated to guide tooth movement progressively, with periodic monitoring to ensure controlled alignment.",
            p3: "Unlike traditional braces, aligners are removable, allowing easier oral hygiene and minimal disruption to daily life. Treatment duration varies depending on alignment complexity and patient compliance. Invisalign offers a modern approach to orthodontic correction while maintaining aesthetic discretion. Consultation determines suitability and expected outcomes."
